"""Render Specter's brand assets: banner (light + dark), social card, and mark.

BACKLIGHT
---------
The Flipper's backlight orange and this project's house gold are sixteen
degrees apart on the same hue wheel, so they are treated as one ramp read from
opposite ends: more INK means more signal on paper, more LIGHT means more
signal on black. Paper is where a sweep ends - Specter writes a timestamped
logbook you can hand to someone. Black is where it happens - Specter's stealth
mode forces the backlight off.

Two laws, both enforced below rather than merely intended:

  LAW 1, THE ORANGE QUARANTINE. EMBER (#FE8A2C) is never a stroke this file
  draws. It is not a chosen colour: every capture in screenshots/ is exactly
  two colours, (254,138,44) and (0,0,0), so it is literally the value the
  product emits. The only ember on any asset is light the device actually
  emitted - i.e. pixels inside a real qFlipper capture, pasted untouched.
  Artwork drawn here uses the ramp one stop cooler, so a drawn band can never
  impersonate the device's own screen. `_guard()` raises if EMBER reaches a
  draw call.

  LAW 2, THE ACCENT MEANS ONE THING. The accent family draws measured carrier
  and nothing else - never a rule, a frame, a margin, a mount or a word. There
  are no gold words anywhere in this system. `text()` raises if an accent token
  is passed as a text fill. The banner therefore has exactly one
  accent-coloured object on it, and that object is a measurement.

Nothing here is typed that could be read: the version comes from specter_i.h,
the waveform and both duty figures come from a hardware capture, and the trace
rows are asserted against views/fingerprint_view.c so a future layout change
fails loudly instead of drawing the wrong row.
